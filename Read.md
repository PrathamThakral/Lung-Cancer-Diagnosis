Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning is a research topic that aims to develop accurate and reliable models to classify and diagnose based on certain features like Air Pollution, Alcohol, Smoking & Risk of Lung Cancer etc. which are used to find the level of chronic lung disease of the patient on an early basis.
Prediction was done using five different Machine Learning Classifiers (Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest)
Multiple Linear Regression Model achieved an accuracy of 93% whereas Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree & Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 100% which was remarkable & an excellent prediction for lung cancer.
Software used: Python 3.7, Kaggle Notebook, Windows 11 operating system.
Dataset: Lung Cancer Prediction from Kaggle Repository
